Changes <br /> 
 <br /> 
1.0 <br /> 
-updated original mod removed alot of the "removed gloomy stuff" <br /> 
-moved stuff around to right menus <br /> 
-fixed rugs to new decor menu in newest gloomy furniture <br /> 
// i have decided to still leave something out from original gloomy, to minimize cluttered menus, 2. wall type will stay out. <br /> 
2 tables removed, second type beds removed, light is untouched. <br /> 
let me know if you missing anything else and i might add it back in. <br /> 





disclaimer<br /> 
Im am no modder/programmer, i have no experience its all trial and error, just feld this was needed and asked for in original mod.
and since Owlchemist left it open to take, i just updated it =) hope he come back someday =) <br /> 
<br /> 
So any ideas/fixes if you know the solution enlighten me, so i dont have to figure how to fix.<br /> 

Thanks to<br />

And all original mod makers that are used in here<br />
